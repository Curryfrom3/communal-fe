## Communal Music

Playlist Making Website

The idea would be using the spotify api in order to make playlists to suit whatever mood youre in. 

The problem it would solve is shuffling music and not having songs that fit the vibes. This would be done by logging in and then showing the playlist that corrispond to the user. This will also let the user, add , edit and remove playlists as they see fit.

The MVP would be a website that finds songs using the API and stores the playlists into an array of some kind in order to store them and view them.
